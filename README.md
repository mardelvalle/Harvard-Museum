# Harvard Museum
This app pulls information from the Harvard Museum's API. This information allows the user to serach a key word and receive in return a link, title and image to a piece in the museum's collect related to the term.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, APIs

When the user types and submits an input value the api returns the first value related to the searched term.

## Optimizations:

Align the search field and the search button.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first use of the get method and my first independent use of an api.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Animal Farm:** https://github.com/mardelvalle/Animal-Farm

**Air Temperature and Map of City:** https://github.com/mardelvalle/Air-Temperature-and-Map-of-City
